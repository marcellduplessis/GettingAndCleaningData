#Input Data
The script assumes the UCI dataset is extracted directly into ./ folder.

#Output Data
The resulting ./tidy_data.txt dataset includes mean and standard deviation variables for the following original variables,
tBodyAcc, tGravityAcc, tBodyAccJerk, tBodyGyro, tBodyGyroJerk, tBodyAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag, fBodyAcc, fBodyAccJerk, fBodyGyro, fBodyAccMag, fBodyBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyBodyGyroMag, fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag by three directions: X, Y , Z.
The above variables where choosen have their original names.

#Raw data pricessing
The run_analysis.R script does the following:

Load files from UCI dataset (UCI HAR Dataset folder)
Merges the test and train files into a single data table
Creates subset, which contains only mean and std variables
Computes the means of this secondary dataset, group by subject and activity.
Saves this final dataset to ./tidy_data.txt
